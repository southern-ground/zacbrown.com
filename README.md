## Install

Clone the repo to your desired location. Open a console to that location and type `npm install`.

## Usage

 Once the install is complete, type `gulp` or `gulp default`. These will start the watcher that monitors for changes to the SCSS files in `<doc_root>/scss`.

 Optionally you can add the flags `--dev` or `--prod` to the command. This will, in the case of `--dev` leave the CSS uncompressed, or `--prod`, compress it down for deployment.

 ### Example

 `gulp --dev`
