The Zac Brown Collective WordPress Theme was built using the HTML 5 Blank
WordPress Theme (http://html5blank.com/).

The CSS for this theme is automatically generated using the taskrunner Gulp. 
Changes made to this file outside of that process will be over-written the 
next time the Gulp task is run. Those changes will be unrecoverable.

If you need to make changes to the styles employed on this site you can set up a 
local development environment, clone the site to your local, download the repo 
from GitHub, install MAMP or something similar if you haven't already, set up the 
appropriate database and users and run the appropriate tasks locally via NPM. 
If you're uncomfortable doing so, please contact the Theme's developer, 
Ferris Thomas (ferris@fsthomas.com) with any change requests.
